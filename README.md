# Pattern Feature Extraction (7x7 Grid)

## Description
This project is written in C language and uses a 7x7 grid made of values 0 and 1.
The program simulates a simple pattern recognition idea by extracting basic features from the grid.

## Program Functionality
- Reads a 7x7 matrix of 0s and 1s from the user
- Displays the matrix as a drawing using:
  - '*' for value 1
  - '.' for value 0
- Calculates simple features:
  - Density (total number of 1s)
  - Number of 1s on the main diagonal
  - Value of the center cell

## Input
The user enters 49 values (0 or 1) representing a 7x7 grid.

## Output
- Visual representation of the grid
- Number of 1s
- Number of diagonal 1s
- Center cell value

## Technologies Used
- C Language
- 2D Arrays
- Loops
- Basic Input and Output
